# **Potion Brewer’s Ledger: SQL Database for a Fantasy Potion Shop**

## **Project Description**
The **Potion Brewer’s Ledger** is a SQL database project designed to manage the intricate details of a fantasy potion shop. This database will track ingredients, potion recipes, and customer preferences, allowing for efficient potion brewing, ingredient sourcing, and customer service. By setting up complex queries, triggers, and stored procedures, this project will demonstrate advanced SQL skills in a whimsical context.

The idea is to create a functional database for a magical shop that serves potions with unique effects, while building a system that is scalable and flexible enough to handle real-world database requirements.

## **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

For the MVP, I’ll start with:
1. **Database Design**: Create the basic schema, including tables for ingredients, potions, customers, and orders.
2. **Ingredient and Potion Tracking**: Implement functionality to track available ingredients and potion recipes.
3. **Customer Preferences**: Add a system to manage customer preferences for specific potions or ingredients.
4. **Basic Queries**: Write simple queries to fetch potion recipes, check ingredient availability, and log customer orders.

## **Rationale for Building an MVP**
I’m starting with an MVP to focus on building the core of the database and demonstrating basic SQL skills. By first setting up a simple structure, I’ll ensure the foundational elements are in place before expanding with more complex features like stored procedures, triggers, and advanced queries. This will allow me to gradually showcase my growing SQL expertise.

## **Future Features**

Once the MVP is complete, I plan to add:
1. **Advanced Queries**: Implement complex queries to handle bulk ingredient orders, potion batch creation, and customer-specific recommendations.
2. **Triggers and Stored Procedures**: Set up triggers for automatic stock updates when ingredients are used, and stored procedures for automating potion creation workflows.
3. **Customer Loyalty Program**: Add features for tracking customer loyalty points, discounts on potions, and preferred potion types.
4. **Ingredient Sourcing**: Create a system for managing supplier relationships, tracking ingredient availability from different sources, and automating restock orders.
5. **Dashboard for Potion Inventory**: Build a dashboard to display available potions, ingredients, and sales trends.
6. **Sales and Reporting**: Add reporting features to analyze sales trends, potion popularity, and customer satisfaction over time.

## **Skills Demonstrated**

This project will showcase advanced SQL and database management skills:

### **Core Skills (MVP)**
- **Database Design**: Create a relational database with appropriate schema and relationships.
- **SQL Queries**: Write basic queries for fetching, updating, and inserting data.
- **Data Management**: Implement data validation and consistency rules within the database.
- **Fantasy-Themed Creativity**: Present the database as a system for managing a magical potion shop, adding a creative spin to traditional database design.

### **Advanced Skills (Future Features)**

## **Installation**

To run this project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/twinkletrees/potion-brewers-ledger.git
   cd potion-brewers-ledger
   ```
2. Set up the database using your preferred SQL platform (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
3. Import the schema file to create the database structure:
   ```bash
   mysql -u username -p database_name < schema.sql
   ```
4. Run basic queries from the provided `queries.sql` file.

---

## **Usage**
- Once the database is set up, you can run queries to manage potion ingredients, recipes, and customer orders. Use the provided SQL scripts to test the core functionality.
